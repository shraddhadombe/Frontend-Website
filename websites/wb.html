			    <p>At UrbanUs Coffee, community includes all of us ... wherever we live, work, rest, and play.<br> Our similarities outweigh our differences and our belief is that we can build community one cup<br> at a time, whether here in the Southwest, with you our customers, and across the globe in the farm<br> communities that produce our delicious coffee beans.But we are more than just a coffee fix, we have<br> a vision to serve and educate through scholarships and training programs in both barista training<br> and roasting; giving the opportunity to elevate youth and the underprivileged with life changing<br> skills and opportunities.Connect with us in person at one of our local Coffee Tasting Events in the<br> Phoenix area.  Follow us on Facebook or Instagram for the next tasting event.</p>
